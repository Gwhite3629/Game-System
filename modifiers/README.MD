### PLAN
    The goal of the modifier system is to allow a dynamic and easily programmable interface for entity modifiers. This will generally consist of callback functions being applied to an entity or gameplay system. This is different from the main engine system because it outlines how a programmer may provide callbacks and modifiers to their own entities rather than to the core engine.
