### PLAN

The goal of the modifier system is to allow a dynamic and easily programmable interface for entity modifiers. This will generally consist of callback functions being applied to an entity or gameplay system. This is different from the main engine system because it outlines how a programmer may provide callbacks and modifiers to their own entities rather than to the core engine.

### TODO

Add actual threads and queues to the occlusion example to perform the actual callback.

Add more map functions like unions on two maps to return a list of pairs. This would be used to simplify the process of performing an operation over a map according to another map as shown in the occlusion example
